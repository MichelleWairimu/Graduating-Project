    <h2>How farmers lose alot when they are not connected directly to the suppliers.</h2>
    <p>Farmers face significant losses when they lack direct connections to their suppliers. Without direct contact, farmers may encounter challenges such as delayed responses to market demands, leading to surplus or scarcity of produce. Moreover, intermediaries often take a substantial portion of profits, reducing the farmers earnings.
      <br />
       Direct connections enable farmers to negotiate fair prices, access timely information on market trends, and establish long-term partnerships for stable income. By bypassing intermediaries, farmers can also ensure the quality and freshness of their products, enhancing consumer trust and satisfaction. Ultimately, direct supplier connections empower farmers with greater control over their livelihoods and economic stability.</p>
